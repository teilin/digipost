Digipost Hackathon 2011
========

An android application that was made at the Posten Dogipost Hackathon in 2011.

The plan for the application was to create an android application that would make it easier for blind people to use Digipost. The idea was that when the blind people pressed a button, text-to-voice function would read the menu option that was pressed.

The difficult part were we got stuck at the Hackathon was the way the digital letters came from Digipost. They only served PDF documents. So we had to make a PDF document that was readable by machines and parse the text out of the document. This was not supported by the android plattform at this time.
